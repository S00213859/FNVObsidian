            <h3>Basic</h3>
            <p>
            In 2004, Bethesda Softworks purchased the license to develop and publish Fallout 3, as well as an option to create two sequels, from Interplay Entertainment. Three years later they bought the Fallout intellectual property. Bethesda abandoned the original gameplay style of previous Fallout titles; instead of an isometric game with action point/turn-based combat, Bethesda's Fallout 3 was a fully 3D game with real-time combat as well as the action point-based V.A.T.S. system.
            </p>
            <p>
            Fallout 3 was a critical and commercial success upon its release in 2008, and Bethesda commissioned a sequel. With their own developers busy working on The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim Bethesda reached out to Obsidian Entertainment, a company founded by several former members of Interplay's original Fallout developers Black Isle Studios, to develop the game. Bethesda and Obsidian decided to create a game that would continue the "West Coast" story rather than the plot of Fallout 3. Bethesda rejected Obsidian's idea to set the game between the events of Fallout 2 and Fallout 3, but they did approve of setting the game in Las Vegas.
            </p>
            <p>
            Discussions for New Vegas began between Obsidian and Bethesda in 2008/09. They knew the game would not be a direct, traditional sequel to Fallout 3, and it was referred to as "Fallout 3.5" within Obsidian. It was specifically designed to be more of an expansion rather than a sequel; Obsidian, however, saw the project as akin to the Grand Theft Auto titles Vice City and San Andreas - not numbered entries, but full games in their own right. As Bethesda "had dibs" on the U.S. East Coast, Obsidian set the game in the American West. Obsidian submitted a three-page pitch to Bethesda for the project, which they named "Fallout: Sin City." The game was later renamed to "Fallout: New Vegas."</p>
            
            <p>The team initially did not have access to the source code until Bethesda cleared the security of it. They used development tools for a few months before they were given the source code, which let them dive in to deeper development.</p>
            
            <p>The game was originally slated to have three playable races - human, ghoul, and super mutant. This idea was abandoned due to issues with the engine, specifically with how the weapons and armor would work. Project director Joshua Sawyer described the development process as having used "sprint overtime," though he does not consider it crunch time. The biggest technical issue that the team faced during development was working with the PS3's hardware; as New Vegas is a very memory-intensive game, they had difficulty with the PS3's split memory pool. The game spent a total of 18 months in development. Sawyer has stated he believes the game realized most of his development ideas during those 18 months.</p>
            
            <p>The game was announced on April 20, 2009, at Bethesda's London showcase. The first official information was released in the February 2010 issue of PC Gamer. A cinematic teaser trailer and a gameplay trailer were then subsequently released.
