            <h3>Fallout: New Vegas</h3>
            <p>Fallout: New Vegas is a post-apocalyptic action role-playing video game developed by Obsidian Entertainment and published by Bethesda Softworks. It was announced in April 2009 and released for Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 3, and Xbox 360 on October 19, 2010. A spin-off of the Fallout series, the game is set in a post-apocalyptic open world environment that encompasses a region consisting of Arizona, California, and Nevada. It is set in a world that deviated onto an alternate timeline thanks to Atomic Age technology, which eventually led to a global nuclear apocalypse in the year 2077 in an event referred to as "The Great War", caused by a major conflict between the U.S. and China over natural resources. The main story of New Vegas takes place in the year 2281, four years after the events of Fallout 3 and 204 years after the bombs fell. It is not a direct sequel, but does mark the return of several elements found in Fallout 2.</p>
            
            <p>Players take control of a character known as the Courier. While transporting a package across the Mojave Desert to the city of New Vegas, what used to be Las Vegas, the Courier is ambushed, robbed of the package, shot, and left for dead. After surviving, the Courier begins a journey to find their would-be killer and recover the package, makes friends and enemies among various warring factions, and ultimately becomes caught up in a conflict that will determine who controls New Vegas and the Mojave Wasteland. New Vegas received positive reviews, with critics praising the game's writing, quests, and improved gameplay, though it was criticized for its glitches and bugs on launch. It was a commercial success, shipping more than 5 million copies, and is estimated to have sold around 12 million copies worldwide. The game received a Golden Joystick Award for "RPG of the Year" in 2011 and was nominated for two BAFTA Awards (Best Strategy Game and Best Story), as well as a NAVGTR Award for Supporting Performance in a Drama (Felicia Day). It has since obtained a cult following, with some critics and audiences referring to the game as among the best in the Fallout series as well as one of the greatest RPGs of all time.</p>

            <h3>Story</h3>
            <p>The game is set in and around a post-apocalyptic retro-futuristic Las Vegas, following the Great War between the U.S. and China, as a conventional and nuclear war that occurred on October 23, 2077. It lasted less than two hours and caused immense damage and destruction. Before the Great War, the Resource Wars took place, during which business magnate and CEO of RobCo Industries Robert House used his vast wealth to make preparations to protect the city. Due to his efforts, out of the 77 atomic warheads that targeted Las Vegas and its surrounding areas, the networked mainframes were able to predict and force-transmit disarm code subsets to 59 of them, neutralizing them before impact. Nine more were destroyed by laser cannons, allowing only a few to make contact outside of the city limits.</p>
            
            <p>Fallout: New Vegas takes place in 2281, four years after the events of Fallout 3, 40 years after Fallout 2, 120 years after Fallout, and six years before the events of Fallout 4. The New California Republic plays a major part in the game's story, being in a three-way struggle among both Mr. House and slave army of Caesar's Legion.</p>

            <p>The Courier, the player character, was meant to deliver a package from Primm to New Vegas but they were intercepted by the Great Khans led by Benny, who shoots them and takes the package, leaving the Courier for dead in a shallow grave. They are rescued by a robot named Victor, and is taken to the town of Goodsprings, where Doc Mitchell saves their life. After the Courier is given some medical tests, they enter the open world, and the quest Ain't That a Kick in the Head begins.</p>
                
            <p>Fallout: New Vegas has a definitive ending, unlike Fallout 3. The endings for Fallout: New Vegas are dependent on what actions are taken during the game's events, with separate endings shown for each major location, political faction, and recruited companion.</p>
